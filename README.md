## Welcome!

### Project Goals:
- To create a full stack application in Typescript using the Object Oriented Programing approach, that persists data to a backend server.
- The classes contained within use a combination of generic types, interfaces, inheritance, and composition.
- Unit testing will be done using Jest.

### Running this project locally
to run this application in the browser:
`npm run start:parcel`

to start up the backend server:
`npm run start:db`

### This project is made with:
- typescript
- node
- parcel
- json-server: sets up a server for us and allows us to save data to a backend database
- axios: for making api calls
- jest for testing

### To run the tests:
- npm t
- Alternatively, to only run 1 test, append `.only` to the test you would like to run. Remember to delete this later.
